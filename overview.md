Absolutely! We can break this project into steps, each with a specific focus. Here's an outline to get us started:

### Project Outline

1. **Create a Basic 2D Track and Visualization**:

   - Use a library like Pygame to draw a simple track layout.
   - Render the track with a visible path, curves, and boundaries.
   - Place a rectangle on the track to represent the car.

2. **Simulate Car Movement**:

   - Define the car’s movement functions: `speed up`, `slow down`, `turn left`, and `turn right`.
   - Implement basic physics to control speed, angle, and position, so the car can move along the track.

3. **Create a Neural Network Model**:

   - Set up a basic neural network model, possibly with TensorFlow or PyTorch, to control the car’s movements.
   - For simplicity, we could start with a feedforward network and adjust based on performance.

4. **Implement Reinforcement Learning**:

   - Use a reinforcement learning algorithm (like Q-learning or Deep Q-Learning) where the car learns by receiving rewards for staying on the track and penalties for going off it.
   - Train the model by allowing the car to "learn" how to navigate the track.

5. **Run and Visualize Training**:

   - Set up a loop where the car learns over multiple episodes.
   - Display the car’s path on the track, showing improvement over time.
